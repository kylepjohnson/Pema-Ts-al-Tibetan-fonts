Technical
---------
The Pema Ts'al orthographic system introduces three characters (a small tseg, big tseg, and cut shad) which are mapped onto the following points within the Unicode block for the Tibetan script (U+0F00–U+0FFF). These characters are as follow:

```
tsegchung (small interpunct, for syllable breaks): U+0FDD
tsegchen (big interpunct, for word breaks): U+0FED
shethung (cut she, for comma): U+0FFD
dragtseg (parallelogram, for uppercase): U+0FDE
drutseg (circle, for transliteration): U+0FEE
drudragtreg (square, for transliteration + uppercase): U+0FFE
```

For more information on the Tibetan Unicode block, see: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_script#Unicode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_script#Unicode).
